# Brian Here HI!!!

My name is Brian, and I was born in Germany.I moved to USA when I was 2 and returned in 2019. As everyone knows I was a cook for 14 years and decided to change careers to Web Development. I have always loved computers, so the transition to Web Development seems to be the best decision for me.

I remember the first time I changed the background color of a web site I was trying to build and tossed my hands up a yelled like I was a fan at a sporting even. Thats when I knew that I was on the right track finding a career I would be happy and excited to be a part of. We all search for that thing we love and make money doing it, and Web Development is that thing. I am super excited for what the future brings for all of us here at DCI. Good things are ahead of us.

ciao,

Brian
